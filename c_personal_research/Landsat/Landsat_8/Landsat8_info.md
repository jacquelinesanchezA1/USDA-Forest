# Landsat 8 

**Quick facts**: <br>
- Landsat 8 was launched February 11, 2013 


- Landsat 8 was first in the Landsat series to provide near real-time data **access to the public** upon its launch


- distinct from its predecessors due to its Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and **Operational Land Imager (OLI)** sensors


## Landsat 8 Architecture

The Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) spacecraft is the satellite that eventually became Landsat 8.
Landsat 8 has aboard two instruments. 

1. **OLI (Operational Land Imager)**: <br>
captures: images in the visible, **near-infrared**, and **shortwave infrared** portions of the electromagnetic spectrum <br>
enables:  detailed observations of the Earth's surface, such as vegetation, water bodies, and urban areas.


2. **TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor)**: <br>
detects: **thermal infrared radiation**, which is used to measure surface temperatures.<br>
useful: for studying land surface temperature, water resource management, and other thermal-related phenomena.
