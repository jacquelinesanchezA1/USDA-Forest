Hi there I noticed you digged deeper into this repository

Iâ€™m excited to share this journey! 

I take notes during every meeting and have many handwritten notes that Iâ€™ll be importing gradually as I analyze them individually again.

Iâ€™m ecstatic about the opportunity to work with professionals from the USDA Forest Service and receive their guidance. Iâ€™m also looking forward to collaborating with a dynamic talented team of individuals that share my enthusiasm.
I am so thrilled by the amount of new things I am learning as I explore many aspect of Geo Spatial Data Analysis!


You'll notice that Iâ€™m an avid gh user, and Iâ€™m committed to keeping my repositories organized and well-documented.

Please be patient as my repo is currently under construction!

Thank you for exploring. <br>
Have a nice day! (:
